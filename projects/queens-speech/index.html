        <p>The Royal Danish Family have addressed the nation on New Year's Eve since 1941. Traditionally, the speech covers important events during the year, regarding both the Denmark and the Royal Family itself. On New Year's Eve 2023, Queen Margrethe announced she would abdicate in the beginning of 2024, leaving the throne to her son. I have collected all New Year Speeches of Queen Margrethe II to a dataset. The intention for this site is to present interesting knowledge about the speeches.</p>

                    Although the speech length varied from year to year, the general trend has been that the length of the speech increased over time. The first decade saw no speeches over 6000 characters long, while the last speech to be shorter than 6000 characters was in the 1980s. The longest 18 speeches were all written in the 21st century, with 2016 having the longest speech (9,818 characters) and 2004 being the second longest speech (9,549 characters).

            <p>Next, I take a closer look into the content of the speeches by assessing the sentiment over time.</p>

                <h1 class="container-title">Sentiment of speeches over time</h1>
                <p class="normal-text">Using NLP modules, I split all speeches into individual sentences and automatically label whether the sentences are positive, negative, or neutral. I then aggregate the sentences to the speech level in order to find out how much of each speech is positive, negative, or neutral. These steps are repeated for each speech, which makes it possible to compare the speeches over time. This is shown in the plot below.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container-graph">

            </div>

            <p>The plot shows how the Queen initially was more hesitant to use negative rhetoric in her speeches. However, after about 5 years, the speeches began to be fairly evenly distributed between the positive, the negative, and the neutral. It was not until the late 80s that this changed. Now the neutral content began to come out on top of each speech, while the positive and negative sentiment varied from year to year, although the positive tended to outweight the negative. Around the new millenium, the positive sentiment started to increase steadily, while the negative declined. From here on, the Queen used about 20% of her speeches for negative sentences, while the positive and neutral sentiment varied around the 40% mark each year. Nevertheless, the positive and neutral still battled each other for dominance as some year saw the positive sentiment slightly outweighing the neutral, and some years saw the neutral tone come out as a clear winner.</p>

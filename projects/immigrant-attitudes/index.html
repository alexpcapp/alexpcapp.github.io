    <h1>Short review </h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:19px;">
        This page gives a shortened presentation of my
        <a href="Bachelor_finaledit.pdf" download>bachelor's thesis</a>
        from 2021. The thesis was written while attending the bachelor's programme at the Department of Sociology, University of Copenhagen. In the thesis, I investigate differences in attitudes towards immigration. Using unsupervised machine learning and Danish survey data from the
        <a href = "https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org">European Social Survey</a>
        , I identify groups in the population, with discrete differences in their attitudes towards immigrants. The empirical results suggest, that anti-immigrant attitudes should not be understood as a continuum from tolerant to intolerant towards immigrants. In fact, there are discrete differences between anti-immigrant populations in Denmark, where the continuous understanding of anti-immigrant sentiment would incorrectly identify these as having the same attitude.</p>

    <h1>Data</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size:19px;"">
        The data for this project comes from the <a href = "https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org">European Social Survey (ESS)</a>. The ESS conducts biannual surveys on a range of topics each year. In addition to the questionnaire issued every round, each round also contains a specific topic of interest. The topic of special interest in this round was attitudes to immigration, a survey module designed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369183X.2018.1550146">Heath et al. (2020).</a> Thus, included in this survey round are both attitudes towards immigration dependent on type of immigrant, ethnic background of immigrants, and attitudes of biological and cultural racism. I remove respondents born outside of Denmark as well as respondents with both parents born outside of Denmark. This removes non-native respondents from the analysis as well as most ethnic minorities, leaving me with a sample of 1,111 respondents. The standard ESS round includes measures of attitudes towards four types of immigrants. The first question is: "To what extent do you think Denmark should allow people of the same race or ethnic group as most of Denmark’s people to come and live here?" In addition, the respondents are asked "How about people of a different race or ethnic group from most of Denmark’s people?", "How about people from the poorer countries in Europe?", and "How about people from the poorer countries outside Europe?"

<div style="height:600px; margin:150px;">
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:19px;">
        My argument state a causal relationship between threat perceptions related to immigration, and the type of immigration opposition one expresses. These threat perceptions will be measure though seven questions from the ESS questionnaire. In the following, I comment on these variables.
Each respondent is asked to answer what effect they believe immigration have on different areas of Danish society, using a scale from 0 to 10. 0 indicates the most normatively positive effect, while 10 indicates the normatively most negative effect. The different topics are cultural life, religious beliefs and practices, the economy, taxes and welfare services, the job level, if immigration makes the country and worse or better place to live, and whether immigration increases or decreases crime the crime level. The distribution of respondents is presented in the figure to the left.
    </p>
  </div>


<div style=" margin-left:150px;">
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:19px;">
        In order to investigate the different 'clusters', groups, or classes in the data, based on immigrant sentiment, I use latent class analysis. According to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of the latent class analysis, a four-class model provides the best representation of the data. Below, two graphs show the results from the latent class analysis. On the left, the BIC values show how the four-class model is identified as the best fit to the data. On the right, the support for each threat perception is visualized for each of the four classes. The support for each perception is used to interpret the attitudes for each class, and subsequently to label these classes. The plot also shows the size of each class in the sample.
    </p>

</div>

<div style="height:600px; margin:150px;">
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:19px;">
        These classes allow me to test my theoretical argument more thorougly. By combining sociodemographic variables and threat perceptions from the data set, I can examine whether the labels of each class makes sense in relation to these. For example, the Cultural Threat Class is expected to be more concerned about threat perceptions, related to cultural threats. This would support the notion, that they are opposing Romani and Muslim immigrants due to these cultural threat perceptions, where such immigrants are undermining to Danish culture. However, when discussing this particular class, other threat perceptions are also highly correlated with class membership. This leads me to speculate, that the labelling and interpretation of the class is either inprecise or incorrect. I discuss this more thoroughly in the actual thesis, which I have linked in the short paragraph in the top of this page.

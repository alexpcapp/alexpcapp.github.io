    <h1>Danish Politicians and Book Publications</h1>
    <p>
        This is the summary of a mini-project I did in the summer of 2023. The project attempts to answer a question I had asked myself a couple of times: do politicians write and publish more books now than earlier? My intuition told me that I noticed more and more politicians publishing books around the last few election (2019 and 2022), although this probably could be explained by recency bias. However, as some of my friends expressed having the same impression, I decided to try and answer this question myself.</p>
